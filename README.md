# Addition of Large Numbers as Strings in C

This C program demonstrates how to perform addition with large numbers represented as strings. When working with extremely large numbers that exceed the capacity of native data types like `int` or `long long int`, you can represent them as strings and implement addition operations using string manipulation techniques.

## Features

- **Addition of Large Numbers:** This program allows you to add large numbers with arbitrary precision, represented as strings.

- **String Manipulation:** The code efficiently handles string representations of numbers and adds them digit by digit.

## How to Use

**Compile the Program:**

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC. Compile the program using the following command:

```bash
gcc -o add_large_numbers main.c
```

## Run the Program:

Execute the compiled program to perform addition on large numbers. Modify the input numbers within the main function of main.c as needed.

```bash
./add_large_numbers
```

The program will display the result of the addition operation.

Feel free to customize and integrate this code into your projects for efficiently adding large numbers represented as strings.
