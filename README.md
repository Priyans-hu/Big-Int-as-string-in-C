# Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic in C

This is a C program that demonstrates how to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, and subtraction) on large numbers that are represented as strings. The code uses string manipulation techniques to handle these operations.

## Features

- Addition of large numbers
- Multiplication of large numbers
- Subtraction of large numbers
- Arbitrary-precision arithmetic using string representation
